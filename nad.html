        <h1>Ninoy Aquino Day </h1>
    <section class="content">
        <p>Ninoy Aquino Day is a national non-working holiday in the Philippines observed annually
             on August 21 commemorating the assassination of former Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, 
             Jr., the husband of Corazon Aquino, who later became the eleventh Philippine President.
              His assassination led to the downfall of the tenth president, dictator, and kleptocrat
             Ferdinand Marcos, which ultimately resulted in the People Power Revolution on 
             February 25, 1986. Since 2004, a commemoration ceremony is traditionally held that was 
             attended by presidents Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Fidel V. Ramos and Benigno Aquino III.
            Unlike other dates reserved for national heroes of the Philippines (like Bonifacio Day, 
            Rizal Day, Araw ng Kagitingan, and National Heroes Day), the date is not a 
            "regular holiday" (double pay for working nationals) but only a "special non-working holiday" 
            (premium of thirty-percent for working nationals), according to the Labor Code of the Philippines. </p>
