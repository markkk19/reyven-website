        <p>Lunar New Year, festival typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries that begins with the first 
            new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar, 15 days later. 
            The lunar calendar  is based on the cycles of the moon, so the dates of the holiday vary slightly 
            from year to year,  beginning some time between January 21 and February 20 according 
            to Western calendars. </p>
