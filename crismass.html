        <p>The celebrations of Christmas in the Philippines have deep influences of 
            Catholicism, tracing their roots back to Spanish colonial rule from 1521 
            to 1898. Currently,  the Philippines holds the longest running festivity
            of the Christmas season in the world, which begins on September 1. </p>
