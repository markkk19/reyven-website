        <p>The Day of Valor, officially known as Araw ng Kagitingan, is a national observance in the
             Philippines that commemorates the fall of Bataan to Japanese troops during World War II.
             The day is officially celebrated every April 9, the start of the Bataan Death March,
              although the date was moved on several occasions to avoid it from coinciding with the 
              observance of the Holy Week in the country,especially the Easter Triduum and Easter
               Sunday, such as in 2004, 2009, 2020, and 2023.</p>
