        <p>Maundy Thursday, the Thursday before Easter, observed in commemoration of Jesus Christ’s 
            institution of the Eucharist during the Last Supper. Ugolino da Siena: The Last Supper
            Ugolino da Siena: The Last SupperThe Last Supper, tempera and gold on wood by Ugolino da Siena, 
            c. 1325–30; in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Judas Iscariot (seated at front
             left) is the only apostle here without a halo. The name is thought to be a Middle English 
             derivation taken from a Latin anthem sung in Roman Catholic churches on that day: “Mandatum 
             novum do vobis” (“a new commandment I give to you”; John 13:34). In most European countries, 
             Maundy Thursday is known as Holy Thursday; other names are Green Thursday (Gründonnerstag; 
             common in Germany), from the early practice of giving penitents a green branch as a token
              for completing their Lenten penance, and Sheer Thursday (clean Thursday), which refers to
               the ceremonial washing of altars on this day.</p>
