        <p>Ferdinand Marcos had been president of the Philippines since 1965. After declaring martial law in 1972,
             he suspended and eventually rewrote the Philippine constitution, curtailed civil liberties, and
              concentrated power in the executive branch and among his closest allies. Marcos had tens of 
              thousands of opponents arrested and thousands tortured, killed, or disappeared.</p>
