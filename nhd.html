    <p>National Heroes Day (Filipino: Pambansang Araw ng mga Bayani) is a public
      holiday in the Philippines celebrated annually on the last Monday of August
     as a tribute to Filipino Heroes.The holiday traces its roots to the Cry
     of Pugad Lawin in August 1896, which marked the beginning of the Philippine
     Revolution.[3] The date and the location of the cry have been long disputed.
     From 1911 to 1962, the cry was thought to have emanated from Balintawak
      (now in modern-day Balingasa, Quezon City) on August 26.[4] In 1963,
      by recommendation of historian Teodoro Agoncillo, the date was changed
     to August 23, and the location was changed to Pugad Lawin in Caloocan 
    (now in modern-day Gulod, Novaliches, Quezon City).[5] Due to the disputed date,
     and with the consensus that the cry occurred in late August, the holiday 
        was then set for the last week of August</p>
