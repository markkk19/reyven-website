        <p>Independence Day, known colloquially as the Fourth of July, is a federal holiday in 
            the United States which commemorates the ratification of the Declaration of 
            Independence by the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, establishing 
            the United States of America.

            The Founding Father delegates of the Second Continental Congress declared that
             the Thirteen Colonies were no longer subject (and subordinate) to the monarch 
             of Britain, King George III, and were now united, free, and independent states.
             The Congress voted to approve independence by passing the Lee Resolution on
              July 2 and adopted the Declaration of Independence two days later, on July 4</p>
